		<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
		<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures how efficient an algorithm is by evaluating how the time required for execution scales with input size.</p>
		<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm needs during execution, and a common example is O(n), which means the memory used grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
